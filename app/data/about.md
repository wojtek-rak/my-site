My name is Sourabh and I am graduate student at Columbia University in New York city. 
<br />
<br />
I pursued my undergraduate degree at IIT Bombay in Mumbai, India. During my time there, I worked on a number of interesting projects in academia, specifically in Theoretical and Computational Physics and also in Computational Neuroscience. I moved to US in 2018 for Grad school at Columbia where I've been learning different aspects of Software Engineering and Machine Learning.

I've spent my time this summer interning at a Fintech startup in midtown called Canoe Intelligence, where I developed algorithms for automatic data extraction from alternative investment documents. Specifically, I worked on implementing state of the art machine learning algorithms to extract data from Hedge Fund, Private Equity and Venture Capital documents. While here, I also got experience working as a full stack developer from Vue.js to PHP to MySql.

When I'm not building things, I spend my time playing basketball and dancing to Dembow and Salsa. Also, I am a history nerd and spend way too much time watching civil war and world war documentaries.
